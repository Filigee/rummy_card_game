# Single Player Rummy Card Game
This is a single player version of the card game 'Rummy' that I made to practise using Fetch APIs.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I made this game using the <a href="deckofcardsapi.com">deckofcardsapi.com</a> API.

## Lessons Learned:

I came across a few challenges whilst making this game. One being that I didn't know how to implement the drag and swap feature, during the process of building that feature I learned a lot about that particular event listener and what it takes to implement that kind of functionality, which I would now feel comfortable adding to my future projects! 

## Things I'd Change:

Towards the end of the project I felt that my code was becoming messy, so in the next iteration I would like to refactor the code and use less global variables. 

In a future iteration I'd like to build out a full 2-player multiplayer version of this game.
